<!-- Using MCP-Powered Cursor Agent to Automate Jira Workflow -->

This use case demonstrates how the **MCP Server** integrated with the **Cursor Agent** can streamline Jira issue management and development workflows. The integration is powered by [mcp-atlassian](https://github.com/sooperset/mcp-atlassian), an open-source MCP server that provides seamless interaction with Atlassian products like Jira and Confluence.

By combining this MCP server's capabilities with Cursor's conversational interface, we were able to query Jira tasks, generate implementation code, push it to a repository, and update the task's status—all in a single, interactive session.

## About MCP Atlassian Server

The [mcp-atlassian](https://github.com/sooperset/mcp-atlassian) server provides a comprehensive set of tools for interacting with Atlassian products through MCP. Key features include:
- Full Jira issue management (create, update, transition, comment)
- Project and issue search capabilities
- Worklog management
- Epic linking and subtask handling
- Confluence integration for documentation

This integration enables developers to manage their entire workflow directly from Cursor, reducing context switching and improving productivity.

### 🛠️ Agent Capabilities Overview

Using the mcp-atlassian server, the agent provides access to all Jira functionalities, including issue creation, updates, transitions, linking, and search:

---

### 🔍 Querying Assigned Tasks

We asked the agent to check for any Jira issues assigned in the **aiblog** project. It correctly used JQL and returned an open task: *Add a menu bar with links to the four latest posts and one link to view all posts*.

### ✨ Implementing the Requested Feature

The agent scanned the existing Jekyll project, created the necessary layout and header files, and implemented the new functionality as requested.

### ✅ Committing and Updating Jira Status

The agent staged and committed the code, pushed it to GitHub, and transitioned the Jira issue from "To Do" to "Done" using MCP tools.
